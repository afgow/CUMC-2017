Abstract: In 1900, German mathematician David Hilbert gave a speech outlining 23 problems (at the time, all unsolved)
; the research conducted in response to these problems has shaped the face of modern mathematics.
In particular, Hilbert’s 10th problem was a challenge to give a finite algorithm which determines whether
or not an arbitrary Diophantine equation has a solution. Over the course of 21 years, the collective work
of Davis, Matiyasevich, Putnam, and Robinson proved that in general, no such algorithm can exist. In this
talk, we will retrace the steps of the unsolvability proof outlined in Davis’ 1973 paper. The audience will
be introduced to several results from both Number Theory and Computability Theory and will receive an
in-depth look at Diophantine sets/equations. Finally, we will see an application of the negative solution to
Hilbert’s 10th problem and review my original research (with Dr. Brandon Fodden) on this topic.
